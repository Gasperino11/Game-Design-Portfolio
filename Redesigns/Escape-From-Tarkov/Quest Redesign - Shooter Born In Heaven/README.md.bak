# Quest Redesign - Shooter Born in Heaven

In the quest 'Shooter Born in Heaven' in <b>Escape from Tarkov</b> (abbreviated EFT) players are tasked with getting headshots on players at over 125 meters on 5 different maps. The quest has gone through several iterations over the years with both the distance and required maps changing. 
The current requirements for the quest are as follows:

- Eliminate 3 PMC operatives with headshots from over 125 meters away on Woods
- Eliminate 3 PMC operatives with headshots from over 125 meters away on Reserve
- Eliminate 3 PMC operatives with headshots from over 125 meters away on Shoreline
- Eliminate 3 PMC operatives with headshots from over 125 meters away on Customs
- Eliminate 3 PMC operatives with headshots from over 125 meters away on Lighthouse

## Why?

The quest itself is an excellent one but could be better. Since EFT is a hardcore game where players can die at any moment (and thus lose their hard earned loot at any moment) many players tend to either play extremely aggressively or extremely cautiously. 
Both of these play styles lend themselves well to close quarters combat and as such I would estimate the majority of engagements in Tarkov happen at under 25 meters. 
Shooter Born in Heaven (abbreviated SBIH) is an excellent task to give to players as it will challenge them to play in a way they might not usually.
Because of the emphasis placed on realism in EFT it will require players to master understanding bullet drop and zeroing their scope while also making them engage with the game's weapon customization system to find suitable optics and gun setups to complete the task.

However experienced players tend to have mixed opinions on the quest while new players tend to avoid the task outright. This is because while the requirements individually may not be too daunting, when combined the task becomes exponentially harder. 
For new players headshots at distance are already a tough ask as it can be difficult to place the shots in such a way that when they do kill a player at distance its from a headshot.
Adding on the map requirement makes it even harder then as some maps required by the quest do not lend themselves to 125 meter plus engagements (such as Reserved and Customs).

EFT is also a game which players can give up on fairly quickly if they feel like they aren't making progress and so making a quest like SBIH easier to complete or at least more player-friendly would hopefully lead to higher player retention.

## How?

The best way to redesign the quest is to change the requirements to the following:

- Eliminate 15 PMC operatives with headshots from over 125 meters away
- Eliminate PMC operatives with headshots from over 125 meters away on 4 different maps

The change from requiring a specific list of maps to any combination of 4 maps keeps the spirit of the quest alive while allowing players more freedom to complete the quest as they see fit. 
Players can't just 'cheese' the quest by getting all 15 headshots on one map unless they are okay with having to get 3 additional headshots at distance, each on a separate map. 

### Pros
- Increased player freedom
- Theoretically reduced difficulty leading to more players completing it

### Cons
- Players could 'optimize' the quest to the point where everyone does the quest on the same map or in the same way (moreso they they already do)

## Next Steps

With this change in place, the next steps would be to track quest completion. By looking at the percentage of players to complete the quest, where they complete it at, etc. the numbers can be tweaked appropriately. For instance, perhaps the map requirement should be 3 or 5 instead of 4.
There have already been several changes to the distance but maybe the distance should be changed further now that the quest is more flexible. Hopefully with these changes in place a larger percentage of the player base (and especially a larger percentage of newer players) will complete the quest.
