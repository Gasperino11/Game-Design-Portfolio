# Classic Burning Crusade Squish

Burning Crusade was WoW's first major expansion, releasing in early 2007. 
It added a significant amount of new content to the MMO, including:

- Increasing the level cap from 60 to 70 and including 7 new zones
- A new race for each faction as well as starting zones for each
- Several new dungeons and raids in the new level range
- A new battleground combining domination and capture the flag game types
- A new methd of traversal in flying mounts
- A new profession for players to take advantage of to augment their gear in new ways

Along with new content, it also revamped old systems like for example reducing the size of raids from 40 players to 25 (or 10 in some cases).
Burning Crusade was universally praised upon release [1]. It was considered a great addition to an already fantastic MMO.

## Burning Crusade Classic & Hardcore

Just adding Burning Crusade as a new expansion does not fix the issues with the current iteration of hardcore.
In fact, it likely would make them worse as it would just add more zones players would likely progress through linearly.
Although it may be impossible to make it so players stop using step by step leveling guides, by adding the Burning Crusade content to the existing level 1 to 60 content, it would add significant variety to the leveling experience.
In addition, for players not using a leveling guide  or just looking for some variety as they level in hardcore, it allows them a variety of choices of where to level.


## How to Squish

### Re-leveling the Burning Crusade Zones:

In the Burning Crusade expansion, each of the 7 zones had a significant amount of overlap in what level ranges they covered.
This is because of how many new zones were added in comparison to how many levels were added as well as the large amount of experience required for each level beyond 60.
The zones were also packed with quests, which allow players a lot of freedom in how they chose to level in Burning Crusade, with several zones being skippable entirely.
In order to squish them into the level 1 to 60 range, their level range will need to be significantly expanded.

Below is a suggestion of how to scale the zones from Burning Crusade to fit into the current leveling range:

| Zone | Original Level Range [2] | New Level Range |
| ---- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| Hellfire Penisula | 58 - 63 | 20 - 30 |
| Zangarmarsh | 60 - 64 | 25 - 35  |
| Terokkar Forest | 62 - 65 | 30 - 40 |
| Nagrand | 64 - 67 | 35 - 45 |
| Blade's Edge Mountains | 65 - 68 | 40 - 50 |
| Netherstorm | 67 - 70 | 48 - 55 |
| Shadowmoon Valley | 67 - 70 | 53 - 60 |

By preserving the zone progression (for example keeping Hellfire Penisula first and Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley last), the story continuity of the Burning Crusade will also be kept intact.

### Breadcrumb quests

In the original Burning Crusade (as well as the class re-release)


In the case of a level squi
For example, in the Redridge Mountains a quest could be added that details how the Blackrock Orcs there were being bolstered by forces slipping through the Dark Portal.
This quest could lead to the mayor Lakeshire sending the player to the Blasted Lands to reach out to the expeditionary forces heading to The Outlands
