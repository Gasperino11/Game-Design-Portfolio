# World of Warcraft Classic & Hardcore

## What is hardcore?

The vanilla version of World of Warcraft (abbreviated WoW from here on out) was fondly remembered for having a challenging leveling experience by modern MMO standards. 
Tasking players with leveling a character from level 1 all the way up to level 60, it often times took players months to reach max level.
With the launch of WoW Classic in 2019 however players were able to showcase just how much had changed since WoW's original 2004 release with players reaching level 60 within just a few days. 
Even though the difficulty of the leveling experience in 2023 is a far cry from what it was in 2004, players continue to enjoy their favorite MMO by finding new and interesting ways to play it.
A prime example of this is the hardcore challenge, which took off in early 2023. 
This challenge requires players to reach level 60 without dying. 
If they die they have to start a new character from level 1.
Although modes like this have been around for a majority of WoW's history (the Ironman challenge is an example), hardcore was popularized in 2023 thanks to community support in the form of an addon [1] as well as several twitch streamers participating.
This increased popularity saw Blizzard announce the addition of official hardcore server for WoW classic [2] which is the first significant change to the game since the re-release in 2019.

## The problem with hardcore:

Although hardcore has breathed new live into WoW Classic for many players, it is obvious that it can't possibly sustain the hype forever in its current form.
The most apparent problem with the game mode is the large amount of reptition. 
As players level characters they are limited in their options on how to level.
Although there are a total of 6 starting zones across the two factions with even more race and class combinations, after players level past about level 20 the leveling path becomes fairly linear with less and less options as players get closer to 60.
This is evident from the fact that tuning into any WoW Classic streamer's stream shows many of them using a step-by-step leveling guide to aid them in leveling.
This reptition has already lead to severl large streamers burning out on the experience after only just a few months of the mode taking off.

## Clasic & Hardcore 2.0

In order to combat this reptition I would suggest two things:

- <b>Classic High Level Revamp</b> : Revamp the higher level zones (40+) from WoW Classic in order to have more quests 
- <b>Classic Burning Crusade Squish</b> :Add in content from additional WoW Classic expansions to add additional level paths

Both of these will be discussed at length in their associated folders.
