# Game-Design-Portfolio
Hi there! If you have found your way to this page 

## Personal Projects
The personal projects folder contains everything I created from scratch - such as maps in Unity or Unreal Engine, demos, miniature games in PyGames, design docs for entire systems and games, etc.

## Redesigns
The redesigns folder contains mainly design docs for features or systems from some of my major games that I would resdesign.
